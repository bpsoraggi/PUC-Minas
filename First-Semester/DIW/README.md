## About
During the semester, we needed to gradually build a website dedicated to showcasing current movies. The website needed to have a specific layout and some specified features.

This project was finalized in 2021, but the links used in it were dynamic, thus the updated content in preview.

## Showcase
### Home page

   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp is an image carousel that displays the 3 main movies.
